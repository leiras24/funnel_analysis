# Funnel Analysis
In this funnel analysis, our goal is to understand how many customers we retain from the moment they view an item to the final step of purchasing it.

Although this analysis was performed on a fictional dataset, it serves to demonstrate how even a simple funnel analysis can provide valuable insights into customer behavior. It also highlights the critical steps in the sales process where further investigation may reveal anomalies or drop-offs worth addressing.

## Steps in the Funnel Analysis

2. Add to Cart
